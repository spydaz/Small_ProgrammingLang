# Namespace

Here i will also attempt to emulate the structure microsoft uses (as it become so clear now) to develop the lang model

## Here the Language Namespace begins!

`   Visual basic is my personal programming language, 
    So it will form the basis of my model; 
    As of Today i have come to understand the  {Json like Nature of code}! 
    so i will also include semicolons and braces where applicable `
