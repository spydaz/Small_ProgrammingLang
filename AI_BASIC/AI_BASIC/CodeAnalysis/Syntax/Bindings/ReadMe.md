# Bindings?

    Do we need them ?

This idea of binding ? 
im not sure what it really is yet but right now my understanding is such that ,
The tree produced by the parser is Still Unconfimed as Expressions are still often as objects and still also contain thier raw data which is a string, 
although the parser attempts to determine these at input, 
operands and other components may still not be in thier final fully typped descriptions,
So The binder attempts to fulfil these aims the emitter stages require simpler 3 address coding strongly typed. 
here this binding procedure provides the transpiler / emitter with a strongly typed tree .
