# Syntax

### expected steps

    -Defining a syntax Layer upon layer
    -Defining the literals first 
    -Then the Expression Statements
      -unary expressions
      -Variable declerations
      -binary Operations
      -Functions
        -If/Then
        -For/Next
        -Do/While
        -For/Until
        -Print
        -Var/Dim/Let
    -Evaluating Statements
    -Emiting Code for compiler /Transpiling for other Languages 
    -CompilingCode
    -Aynalizing Syntax for Editors and code Generators
    -Project file manager(compilerSevices)
### Would hope to be able.
        Add Functions / Classes 

### Defining the syntax for the language requires components to be unified, regardless of the syntax you decide upon
 
    Types and nodes can be collected in to the same namespace,
     as well as defined types being the correct way to iterate through nodes;

### Implemented 
- NumericLiteralExpressions - Can be evaluated 
- UnaryExpressions - Can be evaluated 
- Considering implementing Dates
