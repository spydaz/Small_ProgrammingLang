# Spydaz Virtual Machine Code Language ; 
    Created to execute command through a stack based virtual CPU;
    The output from the interpreter can be execute on this machine.
    Code Generated by the interpreter using the following instruction set can be implemented;


## Description :

	This assembly language is specific to this virtual processor 
	Enabling for the code to be executed on the cpu: 
	
	**This is a Micro based instruction set (Misc)**
	    Uses Reverse Polish Notation
	
# SAL:
	_PUSH		: Pushes items on to the stack (top)
	_POP		: Pops items off the stack (top)
	_PEEK		: Views items on the stack (top)
	_WAIT		: Pauses execution of code
	_PAUSE		: Pauses execution of code
	_HALT		: HALT execution of code
	_RESUME		: Resumes execution of code
	_DUP		: Duplicates item on the stack (top)
	_JMP		: Jumps to location
	_JIF_T		: Jump if true
	_JIF_F		: Jump if False
	_JIF_EQ		: Jump if Equals
	_JIF_GT		: Jump if Greater than
	_JIF_LT		: Jump if Less than
	_LOAD		: Load Memory Address
	_STORE		: Store at memory Address
	_REMOVE		: Removes item at memory address so location can be free for replacement or updated item
	_CALL		: call location in memory
	_RET		: Return to location called
	_PRINT_M	: Prints to TextConsole Display
	_ADD		: Adds last two items on the stack
	_SUB		: subtracts last two items on the stack
	_MUL		: multiply last two items on the stack
	_DIV		: divides last two items on the stack
	_AND		: if both last two items on the stack are true
	_OR			: if either last two items on the stack are true
	_NOT		: if both last two items on the stack are not true
	_IS_EQ		: if both last two items on the stack are Equals
	_IS_GT		: both items are compared 
	_IS_GTE		: both items are compared 
	_IS_LT		: both items are compared 
	_IS_LTE		: both items are compared 
	_TO_POS		: number is sent to negative
	_TO_NEG		: number is sent to positive
	_INCR		: number is incremented by 1
	_DECR 		: number is Decremented by 2
	
The Current instruction Set Will Later include a memory register location system ; (after researching different models and implementations)( a virtual machine model based on this was created using a stack machine style. this will form the basis of my (Virtual Machine) - to be developed over time (maybe even format a virtual disk in the future)
