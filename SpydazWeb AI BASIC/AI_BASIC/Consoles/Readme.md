     --  #ShowTokens
     --  #cls
     --  #Repl
     --  #ide

    Repl 1 : ConsoleRepl Basic Rig 
    Repl 2 :(#Repl) Test Repl Visual test IDE for Emulators (Current VM); 
            and Programming Languages AST viewer.(Testing rig)
    Repl 3 : (#ide) Editor - Basic Editor! (InteligentTextbox 
             with intelitext on Tabkey(tab Disabledd))

## (Bonus Items) 

SomeBonusControls Have been created to make the IDE nice and Workable

##  - Inteligent Textbox with Popup Intelitext :
(requires Narrowing as too default syntax will reduce this one to the current tokenset),
SyntaxHighlighting also added to Textbox. 



##  - LineNumberer :  
 Snap to textbox and Assign to control to Give textbox LineNumbers
